### Observations & Learnings
* This was a very helpful exercise to draft and consider how the mappings of data will converge with the front end design. At the moment there are still a number of elements that are outstanding.
* One of these considerations is user login information and credentials when a user signs in. 
---
### Challenges / Opportunities
* An opportunity moving forward is to consider how much of the design can actually be initiated in the timeframe we have.
* Better understanding the benefits of SQL and NOSQL Databases will be an important part moving forward.
