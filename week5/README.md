Assignment 5 Details: [Week 5](https://github.com/leeallennyc/data-structures-fall-2020/blob/master/week5/week5_assignment.md) 

## Summary:
The purpose of this assignment was to setup a [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) NoSQL database in AWS, and post data from a process blog into the database.

### Process

#### Step One
* Using a similar framework to last week, I began sketching first: 
* I came up with the following questions based on the [html data]('https://parsons.nyc./aa/m06.html') from `https://parsons.nyc./aa/m06.html`

* The categories fell into `time/availability`, `travel distance`,  `wheelchair access`, `interests`, and `new or returning members`. 
* My first attempt.

#### Step Two
* Next we set up a DynamoDB NoSQL database in AWS as illustrated [here](https://github.com/leeallennyc/data-structures-fall-2020/blob/master/week5/week5_postgresdb.md). 
* Building on our work from the previous weeks, our goal was to begin the process of moving data into the AWS database, and building a schema based on how we might think through the user experience of searching for a AA meeting in NYC. 

#### Step Three
* 

#### Step Four
* Finally, we make selection from the Database we set up and return the data:
