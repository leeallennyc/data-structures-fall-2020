## Summary:
The purpose of this assignment was to setup a Postgres Relational DB in AWS, develop a schema for AA meetings data, and use SQL to load data into our database. 
--- 
### Process
* Before beginning the assignment we transferred our account to another AWS educate account.
* Next we set up a Postgres DB instance on AWS as illustrated [here](https://github.com/leeallennyc/data-structures-fall-2020/blob/master/week4/weekly_assignment_04_documentatiton.md). 
* Building on our work from the previous weeks, our goal was to begin the process of moving data into the database, and building a schema based on how we might think through the user experience of searching for a AA meeting in NYC.
