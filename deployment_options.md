## deployment options for [final assignments](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/tree/master/final_app_demo)

#### OPTION ONE (RECOMMENDED): 

Using QuickTime, Zoom, or similar software to make a screen recording showing a walkthrough of the working prototype of your application hosted on Cloud9. Narration/audio is encourage, but not required. The screen recording should show the functionality of all three final assignments, emphasizing the relationship between user inputs (even if that is only date/time of request) and the visualization. Submit to Canvas the url of your video. 

#### OPTION TWO: 

Upload your code to [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/),  "an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications." The most straightforward way of doing this is to upload a zip file of your source code. Note that [environment variables are handled differently in Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environments-cfg-softwaresettings.html). Submit to Canvas the url of your Beanstalk application.

#### OPTION THREE: 

Deploy a [serverless web application to AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/web-apps/). Submit to Canvas the url of your Lambda application.
